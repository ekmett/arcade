* try swapping out parts to use legal asm.js for faster firefox rendering

* make better use of temporaries

* move client/server communication out to a web worker

* more radically we could move all physics out to a web worker, but then we're communicating a lot per frame
* and will need to collect those communications

* Separate bodies and sortables, so we can display line segments between linked objects more correctly.

* contemplate a switch to pixi.js or something like it. an optional z-buffer would be amazing!

* switch from direct class use to Fiber.js for everything

* Use Object.defineProperty to make more things look like properties for constants, frame #'s etc.

* Add an appCache before we go to production
